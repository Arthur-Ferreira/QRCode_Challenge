## My process

- Created semantic HTML first
- Used GIMP (utilising guides and rulers) to help understand spacing and sizing for various elements of the design using the images provided
- Created CSS selectors to:
  - create custom variables to contain the various colours and font sizes used in the design
  - reset margin and padding to 0 with box-sizing: border-box to help with more accurate size measurements
  - layout the design using Flexbox
  - style the various elements
  - create a diffent width layout for desktop version

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (responsive design)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)

### Learned

This project served as a platform for honing my skills in time estimation and project delivery. As a beginner's endeavor, I focused solely on utilizing essential tools such as HTML5 and CSS3.

### Continued development

As part of ongoing development, I plan to enhance this basic HTML and CSS component by transitioning it into a React component. Additionally, I intend to leverage styling libraries like Styled Components to elevate it into a more sophisticated and feature-rich component.
